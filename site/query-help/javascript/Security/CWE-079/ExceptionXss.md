# Exception text reinterpreted as HTML
Directly writing exceptions to a webpage without sanitization allows for a cross-site scripting vulnerability if the value of the exception can be influenced by a user.


## Recommendation
To guard against cross-site scripting, consider using contextual output encoding/escaping before writing user input to the page, or one of the other solutions that are mentioned in the references.


## Example
The following example shows an exception being written directly to the document, and this exception can potentially be influenced by the page URL, leaving the website vulnerable to cross-site scripting.


```javascript
function setLanguageOptions() {
    var href = document.location.href,
        deflt = href.substring(href.indexOf("default=")+8);
    
    try {
        var parsed = unknownParseFunction(deflt); 
    } catch(e) {
        document.write("Had an error: " + e + ".");
    }
}

```
